Description:
Rapidjson is an attempt to create the fastest JSON parser and generator.

* Small but complete. Supports both SAX and DOM style API. SAX parser only a few hundred lines of code.
* Fast. In the order of magnitude of strlen(). Optionally supports SSE2/SSE4.2 for acceleration.
* Self-contained. Minimal dependency on standard libraries. No BOOST, not even STL.
* Compact. Each JSON value is 16 or 20 bytes for 32 or 64-bit machines respectively (excluding text string storage). With the custom memory allocator, parser allocates memory compactly during parsing.
* Full  RFC4627 compliance. Supports UTF-8, UTF-16 and UTF-32.
* Support both in-situ parsing (directly decode strings into the source JSON text) and non-destructive parsing (decode strings into new buffers).
* Parse number to int/unsigned/int64_t/uint64_t/double depending on input
* Support custom memory allocation. Also, the default memory pool allocator can also be supplied with a user buffer (such as a buffer allocated on user's heap or programme stack) to minimize allocation. 

As the name implies, rapidjson is inspired by rapidxml. 
  
Local Modifications:

* Removed bin/, build/, doc/, example/, test/, thirdparty/ keeping include/ as this 
  is a header only library.
